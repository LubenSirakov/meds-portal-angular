# Welcome to Meds Portal 
Meds Portal is the place where you'll find anything and everything about meds. Here you can add new meds, edit existing ones, add meds to your collection, and much more!

## Overall
This is my submission for the regular Angular exam by SoftUni.
For this project I've used Angular for the client-side and Firebase for the back-end.

## Functionality
As a guset you can view the Home page, All meds, Login and Register pages. However you cannot interact with the meds in the database without login in.

As a registered user you can view all pagesand interact with the meds.
You can register and login with email and password.

You can add new meds to the databse and edit the ones you've added.
If you wish you can also delete a med from the database, but only if it's uploaded by the current user.
In My Profile page you'll see all the meds you've added. If you click on My Meds you'll see the meds you added to your personal collection.

## How to run the app?

In the project directory, you can run:

### `ng serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
